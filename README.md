This is an interntal created by me for the Center for Faculty Leadership and Development (CFLD) at The University of Texas at El Paso.
It's a website built with React (frontend) and Django (backend) using SQLite (database). At some point I will switch the databases to MySQL.

This website stores other projects made by CFLD and keeps track of their status. It checks if the site is active, response time, SSL certificate, etc. It also alerts the manager if something wrong is happening with the site.

Please contact me if you need more information about this project.

Thanks!
Sebastian :)
